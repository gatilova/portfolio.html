<h1>More about me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Anastasiia Hatilova and I'm a passionate beginner web developer with a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. I recently completed the renowned web development course by Angela Yu on Udemy, where I gained a wealth of practical skills that have shaped my journey into the world of coding.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML5 & CSS3: I learned to structure websites and apply modern styling techniques to create responsive and visually appealing layouts.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: I gained a deep understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with APIs to make dynamic, interactive web pages.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: By mastering the use of Flexbox and CSS Grid, I can build websites that look great on any device—whether it is a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.</li>
    <li>Version Control (Git & GitHub): I am proficient in using Git to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage code in repositories via GitHub.</li>
    <li>Front-End Frameworks: I have worked with popular libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap to streamline the development process and ensure a professional look and feel for web projects.</li>
    <li>Backend Development (Node.js & Express): I have gained hands-on experience with back-end technologies, building servers and RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, enabling me to create full-stack applications.</li>
    <li>Database Management: I have worked with MongoDB to understand how to store, retrieve, and manipulate data effectively in a NoSQL database.</li>
    <li>Debugging & Problem-Solving: I've honed my ability to debug code, optimize performance, and troubleshoot issues to ensure a smooth user experience.</li>

</ul>
<p>The course did not just teach me technical skills; it also helped me develop a problem-solving mindset, which is essential for any developer. I'm now more confident in taking on new challenges, and Iam eager to apply my skills to real-world projects.</p>
<h2>Open to Career Opportunities</h2>
<p>I’m excited to continue my journey and expand my skills further. Whether it's freelance projects, collaborations, or full-time opportunities, I am actively looking to apply what I have learned in a professional setting. I’m eager to contribute to impactful projects and grow within a dynamic team.
