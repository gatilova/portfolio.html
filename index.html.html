    <h2>I'm a Web Developer</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>I'm a beginner web developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through a comprehensive online course, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in building responsive websites, creating interactive user interfaces, and understanding web development best practices. I have also learned how to work with version control tools like Git and GitHub, ensuring collaborative and efficient project workflows. My goal is to continue learning, improve my coding skills, and work on real-world projects to build a versatile portfolio.</p>
